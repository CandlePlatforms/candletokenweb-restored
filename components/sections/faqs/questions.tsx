    answer: (

        <p sx={{ mb: 3 }}>
          Setting up your own broadcaster connected directly to the Candle
          public network and using the Candle.com hosted service both allow you
          to transcode on the same scalable, reliable, affordable Candle public
          network. Initial setup for a Broadcaster node can involve some DevOps
          and requires that you pay in a cryptocurrency (ETH). But, there is
          large, global Candle community ready to help. The Candle Discord
          server is very active.
        </p>
        <p>
          Candle.com is great getting started quickly and growing a video
          platform fast with the complexities of blockchain and cryptocurrencies
          abstracted away for you. It offers a scalable end-to-end video
          infrastructure solution, from ingest to CDN playback for live and
          recorded streams. Don’t hesitate to reach out on the Discord server or
          via a contact form on Candlelabs.org to learn more about either
          option.

        The price you should set should be based on the max price broadcasters
        are willing to pay. For example, Candle Inc’s broadcasters have a max
        price set at 3k wei per pixel which comes out to around 40 cents per
        hour per stream for its customers so if you want to win this work set
        your price at or below 3k wei per pixel.
